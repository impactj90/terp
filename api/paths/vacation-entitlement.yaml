    summary: Preview vacation entitlement for an employee
    description: |
      Calculates and returns a detailed breakdown of vacation entitlement for an employee in a given year.
      Uses the employee's employment type to resolve the calculation group, or accepts an optional override.
      Does NOT persist the result -- use /vacation-balances/initialize for that.
