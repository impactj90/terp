  description: |
    RESTful API for the Terp application - Time & Resource Planning.

    ## Authentication
    All endpoints except `/health` and `/auth/*` require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <token>
    ```

    ## Pagination
    List endpoints support cursor-based pagination:
    - `limit`: Number of items to return (default: 20, max: 100)
    - `cursor`: Cursor for next page (returned in response)

    ## Error Responses
    All errors follow RFC 7807 Problem Details format.

    ## File Structure
    This spec is organized into:
    - `paths/` - API endpoint definitions by domain
    - `schemas/` - Data models by domain
    - `responses/` - Reusable response definitions
