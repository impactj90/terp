    ## Authentication

    All endpoints except `/health` and `/auth/*` require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header:

    ```

    Authorization: Bearer <token>

    ```


    ## Pagination

    List endpoints support cursor-based pagination:

    - `limit`: Number of items to return (default: 20, max: 100)

    - `cursor`: Cursor for next page (returned in response)


    ## Error Responses

    All errors follow RFC 7807 Problem Details format.


    ## File Structure

    This spec is organized into:

    - `paths/` - API endpoint definitions by domain

    - `schemas/` - Data models by domain

    - `responses/` - Reusable response definitions

        Recalculates the monthly aggregation from daily values.

        Applies credit type rules from the employee's tariff configuration:

        - no_evaluation: Direct 1:1 transfer of overtime/undertime

        - complete_carryover: Full transfer with monthly cap and annual balance limits

        - after_threshold: Credit only overtime exceeding the configured threshold

        - no_carryover: Reset balance to zero


        Monthly cap (max_flextime_per_month), positive cap (upper_limit_annual),

        and negative cap (lower_limit_annual) are applied in sequence.

        Returns error if the month is closed.

            update operation. Represents the raw terminal or manual ingest time.

            /bookings/{id}. When changed, calculated_time is cleared and
            recalculated on next day calculation.
