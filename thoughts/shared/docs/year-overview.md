# Year Overview (/year-overview)

## Purpose
Provide a year-at-a-glance view of monthly totals, flextime trends, and vacation usage.

## Audience
- Users: View their own year summary.
- Admins: Select any employee.

## How to use (step-by-step)
1. Open Year Overview from the main navigation.
2. (Admin only) Select an employee.
3. Choose the year with the selector.
4. Review summary cards and flextime chart.
5. Review the monthly breakdown table; click a month to open Monthly Evaluation.
6. Use Export for a year summary file.

## Data and fields
- Monthly values: target, net, balance minutes by month.
- Flextime chart: derived from monthly balance minutes or account balance.
- Vacation used/entitlement for the selected year.

## Where changes take effect / integrations
- Monthly Evaluation is the drill-down for each month.
- Vacation data matches the Vacation page for the same year.

## Troubleshooting
- If data fails to load, use Retry; the page relies on monthly values and vacation balance endpoints.
- Admins must select an employee to see data.
