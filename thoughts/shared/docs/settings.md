# Settings (/settings)

## Purpose
User settings entry from the user menu. A dedicated page is not implemented in the current UI.

## Audience
- Users and Admins: Navigation entry is visible in the user menu.

## How to use (step-by-step)
1. Click Settings in the user menu.
2. The route is not implemented, so the application will show a Not Found page.

## Data and fields
- No settings UI is implemented in the current frontend.

## Where changes take effect / integrations
- Account settings are handled on the Profile page instead.

## Troubleshooting
- A 404/Not Found is expected because the route is not implemented.
