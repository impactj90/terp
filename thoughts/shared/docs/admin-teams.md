# Teams (Admin) (/admin/teams)

## Purpose
Manage teams, assign a team leader, and organize team membership.

## Audience
- Admins: Full access.
- Users: Not available; non-admins are redirected to the Dashboard.

## How to use (step-by-step)
1. Open Teams from the Admin navigation.
2. Click New Team to create a team.
3. Set the team name, optional description, department, and team leader.
4. Use the Member Management sheet to add or remove team members.
5. Use View or Edit to inspect or update team details.

## Data and fields
- Name, description.
- Department (optional).
- Team leader (employee).
- Active status.
- Member list with roles (as shown in the member management sheet).

## Where changes take effect / integrations
- Team membership affects Team Overview and Admin > Approvals filters.
- Team leader and department information appear in team detail views.

## Troubleshooting
- If no departments or employees appear, create them first in Admin > Departments and Admin > Employees.
- Inactive teams are hidden from Team Overview by default.
