# Profile (/profile)

## Purpose
Let users view their personal and employment details and manage account settings.

## Audience
- Users and Admins: same functionality for their own account.

## How to use (step-by-step)
1. Open Profile from the user menu.
2. Review personal info, employment details, contacts, and access cards.
3. Edit Display Name in Account Settings and save.
4. Use the Notifications link to manage notification preferences.

## Data and fields
- User account: email (read-only), display name (editable), role.
- Employee record: name, contact info, entry/exit dates, department, cost center, employment type, weekly hours, vacation days.
- Contacts: emergency and other contact entries.
- Access cards: card number, type, validity dates, active status.
- Time Plan card is a placeholder ("Coming soon").

## Where changes take effect / integrations
- Employee data is used across Timesheet, Absences, Team Overview, and Admin views.
- Display name updates appear in the header and activity lists.

## Troubleshooting
- If no employee is linked, only account settings are shown and employee-specific cards are replaced by a message.
- Password change is a placeholder and not yet available in the UI.
