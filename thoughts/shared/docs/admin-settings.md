# Settings (Admin) (/admin/settings)

## Purpose
Navigation entry for administrative settings. A dedicated page is not implemented in the current UI.

## Audience
- Admins: Navigation entry is visible.
- Users: Not available.

## How to use (step-by-step)
1. Click Settings in the Admin navigation.
2. The route is not implemented, so the application will show a Not Found page.

## Data and fields
- No admin settings UI is implemented in the current frontend.

## Where changes take effect / integrations
- Settings are not exposed in the current UI.

## Troubleshooting
- A 404/Not Found is expected because the route is not implemented.
