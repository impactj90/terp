# Notifications (/notifications)

## Purpose
Central inbox for system notifications and a place to manage notification preferences.

## Audience
- Users and Admins: same functionality.

## How to use (step-by-step)
1. Open Notifications from the header bell icon or directly from the route.
2. Use filters to narrow by type or unread status.
3. Click a notification to open its linked page and mark it as read.
4. Use "Mark all read" to clear unread notifications.
5. Switch to Preferences to enable/disable categories.
6. Save preferences.

## Data and fields
- Notification type: approvals, errors, reminders, system.
- Title, message, created time, read status.
- Preferences: approvals_enabled, errors_enabled, reminders_enabled, system_enabled.

## Where changes take effect / integrations
- Notifications link into related pages (e.g., approvals or timesheet).
- Preferences control which categories are delivered across the app.

## Troubleshooting
- If the list is empty, there are no notifications matching the current filters.
- If saving preferences fails, retry; the settings are stored in the backend.
