# Monthly Evaluation (/monthly-evaluation)

## Purpose
Summarize and manage monthly time calculations, including close/reopen actions and exports.

## Audience
- Users: View their own monthly summary and daily breakdown.
- Admins: Select any employee and close/reopen months.

## How to use (step-by-step)
1. Open Monthly Evaluation from the main navigation.
2. (Admin only) Select an employee.
3. Navigate months using the arrows or Current button.
4. Review summary cards and daily breakdown table.
5. Close the month when all days are correct; reopen if corrections are needed.
6. Use Export to download monthly data.

## Data and fields
- Monthly value: target, gross, break, net, balance minutes; working/absence/holiday day counts; status (open/closed).
- Daily values: per-day target, gross, break, net, balance, and errors.

## Where changes take effect / integrations
- Closing a month locks daily values, which limits edits in Timesheet.
- Monthly values roll up into Year Overview and flextime balances.

## Troubleshooting
- "No employee record" means the user is not linked to an employee.
- Close Month is disabled if no monthly value exists yet.
- Future months cannot be navigated beyond the current month.
