# Test Skill (Placeholder)

## Purpose

Provide a minimal, do-nothing skill scaffold for testing skill discovery and loading.

## Instructions

- Acknowledge that this is a placeholder skill.
- Ask the user what specific behavior or workflow they want the skill to cover.
- If asked to do work, proceed with normal best-effort behavior while noting that the skill has no specialized resources.
